			Anyone can make something cheaper by cutting corners and pricing it for less. So it’s important to know what is and is not included in any heating and cooling system you select for your home. Our Price Guarantee is our promise to you that you will not find a comparable installation for less, or we’ll rebate you the difference plus a $100 bonus. Comparison must be “apples to apples”.

			We recognize that not every manufactured piece of heating or air conditioning equipment is 100% perfect all of the time. Since our customers should expect to receive 100% of the heating and air conditioning value they’ve invested in, we offer an exclusive “No Lemon” guarantee. Simply stated, if the compressor in your air conditioner should fail during the first five years of ownership or the heat exchanger in your furnace should crack during the first five years of ownership, we’ll install a completely new compressor or heat exchanger for free.
